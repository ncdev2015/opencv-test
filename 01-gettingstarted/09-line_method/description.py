	image: It is the image on which line is to be drawn. 
	start_point: It is the starting coordinates of the line. The coordinates are represented as tuples of two values i.e. (X coordinate value, Y coordinate value). 
	end_point: It is the ending coordinates of the line. The coordinates are represented as tuples of two values i.e. (X coordinate value, Y coordinate value). 
	color: It is the color of the line to be drawn. For RGB, we pass a tuple. eg: (255, 0, 0) for blue color.
	thickness: It is the thickness of the line in px.
