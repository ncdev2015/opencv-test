OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. cv2.cvtColor() method is used to convert an image from one color space to another. There are more than 150 color-space conversion methods available in OpenCV. We will use some of color space conversion codes below.

"""

"""

Syntax: cv2.cvtColor(src, code[, dst[, dstCn]])

Parameters:
src: It is the image whose color space is to be changed.
code: It is the color space conversion code.
dst: It is the output image of the same size and depth as src image. It is an optional parameter.
dstCn: It is the number of channels in the destination image. If the parameter is 0 then the number of the channels is derived automatically from src and code. It is an optional parameter.

Return Value: It returns an image.
